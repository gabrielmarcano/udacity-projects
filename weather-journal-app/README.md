## Description

This is my personal project for the Udacity Frontend Web Development Nanodegree Program.

The app lets you know the temperature of any place, using the zip code. Then, it shows the output with a personalized message.

The project consist in working with asynchronous code in order to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API and use the data to change the UI of my app.
